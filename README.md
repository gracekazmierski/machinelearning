# Machine Learning Projects

---

Welcome to my personal collection of machine learning projects and explorations!

This repository serves as a showcase of various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, primarily implemented using Python and Google Colaboratory notebooks. Each subfolder within this repository contains a self-contained project, complete with its respective Jupyter/Colab notebook (`.ipynb` files).

## Projects

* **[King County Housing Predictions]**: Developed an XGBoost regression model to predict home prices in King County, WA. This project involved leveraging a dataset of over 20,000 rows, enriching it with external API data, and implementing a robust preprocessing pipeline. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated against a dedicated holdout set.
* **[Bank Marketing Campaign Predictions]**: This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing campaign data to identify distinct customer segments, predict customer responsiveness to future campaigns, and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of targeted, data-driven marketing strategies over random approaches for key stakeholders.
