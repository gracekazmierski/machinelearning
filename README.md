# Machine Learning Projects

---

Welcome to my personal collection of machine learning projects and explorations!

This repository serves as a showcase of various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, primarily implemented using Python and Google Colaboratory notebooks. Each subfolder within this repository contains a self-contained project, complete with its respective Jupyter/Colab notebook (`.ipynb` files) and any associated data, model files (`.pkl`), or other necessary assets.

## What's Inside?

This repository is organized into individual project folders. Here's a general idea of what you might find:

* **Project Folders:** Each folder represents a distinct machine learning project (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Image Classification`, `Time Series Analysis`).
* **Colab Notebooks:** The core of each project, demonstrating the code, explanations, and results.
* **Data Files:** Small datasets used within the notebooks.
* **Trained Models:** Saved models (e.g., `.pkl` files) if applicable.
* **Supporting Files:** Any other files necessary for the project to run or be understood.

## How to Explore

To dive into any project, simply:

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning.git](https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning.git)
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username!)

2.  **Navigate** to the specific project folder you're interested in.

3.  **Open the `.ipynb` file** using Google Colaboratory (upload it there) or a Jupyter Notebook environment on your local machine.

## Projects (Coming Soon!)

Here's where you'll list your individual projects. As you add more notebooks, just update this section!

* **[King County Housing Predictions]**: Developed an XGBoost regression model to predict home prices in King County, WA. This project involved leveraging a dataset of over 20,000 rows, enriching it with external API data, and implementing a robust preprocessing pipeline. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated against a dedicated holdout set.
* **[Bank Marketing Campaign Predictions]**: This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing campaign data to identify distinct customer segments, predict customer responsiveness to future campaigns, and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of targeted, data-driven marketing strategies over random approaches for key stakeholders.
